This is a BC break as people might have relied on the fact that a `@Security` annotation on an action overrides one on the class.

Maybe the new behavior should be explicitly and globally configured by the developer under the `sensio_framework_extra` config key.

Please, no global configuration, that never works; what about one bundle needing one value for the global configuration and another one needing another one.

That's a fair point!

:+1: from me, but I agree on the BC break, maybe this should cause a major bump.

A major bump would cause the same problem that a global configuration. Some bundles would need the old version and some the new one.

Maybe create a new Annotation that have the new behavior ?

@iltar directed me to this PR, as I was assuming the `@Security` annotation was "stackable" i.e. could be used on a class, and then applied again on a specific action for further additional restrictions.

I like @jvasseur's suggestion of a new annotation... maybe `@StackableSecurity`?
