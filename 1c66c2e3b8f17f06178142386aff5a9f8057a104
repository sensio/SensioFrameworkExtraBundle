Can you add some tests?

I did, but it required to add doctrine as dev dependency for being relevant and that seems to reveal an issue in doctrine-bundle's twig requirement...

> Error: Class 'Twig_SimpleFilter' not found
/home/travis/build/sensiolabs/SensioFrameworkExtraBundle/vendor/doctrine/doctrine-bundle/Twig/DoctrineExtension.php:40

See travis build with low deps.

I can't figure it out right now, maybe you have an idea since you made the change that makes use of `Twig_SimpleFilter` in doctrine-bundle?

Changing the twig requirement from `1.11` to `1.12` made it green.
Opened https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/pull/614 to fix it on doctrine too.
