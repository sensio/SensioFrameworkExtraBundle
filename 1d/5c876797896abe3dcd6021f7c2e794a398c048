Thank you for your contribution. I find it highly confusing to mix annotations and attributes into the same example. Can we use separate code blocks for them, like in symfony/symfony-docs#14230?

OK, I will update the PR.

I updated the docs. Hopefully, I did it right, as it was my first time to work with the rst format.
