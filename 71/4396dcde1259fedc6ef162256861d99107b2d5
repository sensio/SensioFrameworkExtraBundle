Just updated but fabbot is not yet happy about it. Shall I change also the return statements even I have not touched them?

No need to fix the fabbot issue, but can you add some unit tests to cover your changes.

Sure, just added one. However this test fails hard with the old code but it covers the current use case. Otherwise I have to add (useless) mocks.
