Parameter in main documentation page was missing. Updated.

It looks like the build is failing due to other changes (I suppose they are being fixed). @fabpot can you merge this PR? It's a very useful addition for people using their own entity annotations

 +1 for this, nice explicit addition.

Is there any problem about this PR?

+1, it's a great addition. @fabpot can this PR be merged, please? It really helps when using custom annotations.
