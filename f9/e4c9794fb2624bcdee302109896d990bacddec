The decision about the code is very hard. I took the same code as in `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response`. But I was not able to find a reference about theses codes in the HTTP RFC.

The RFC said "A cache able response should be successful', But also: "Everything is cachable is headers said to cache".

So maybe, we should remove the `if` block
