Thank your for your PR. I think, @fabpot has to enable GHA on this repository first.

You should be able to merge the two jobs, like we did here:

Good hint, never used `ramsey/composer-install` before, thanks @derrabus üëç
Works now, even though tests are still failing (but unrelated to this PR).
