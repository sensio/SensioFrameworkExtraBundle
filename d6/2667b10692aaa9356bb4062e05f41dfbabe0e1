@fabpot oh, no! Can you merge #430 into 3.x first, please?

LGTM, BC wise there's nothing I foresee any issues with but I can't say I've extended the annotations. As soon as this is merged, I will hook it up in one of our applications to see if anything breaks (doubt it).

If the minimum requirement for the http-kernel can be bumped to 3.1, the `PsrServerRequestParamConverter` could be turned into an `ArgumentValueResolver`: https://github.com/sensiolabs/SensioFrameworkExtraBundle/blob/master/Request/ParamConverter/PsrServerRequestParamConverter.php

3.0 is not supported anymore anyway, so totally possible. Can you work on a patch?

I'll see if I have an hour to spare tomorrow

üëç I just tested this with The Symfony Demo, which uses many of these features and had no issue (tests pass too).
